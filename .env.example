### GLOBAL VARIABLES ###

# If !false, Next's bundle(s) will be analyzed and report files generated.
ANALYZE=false

# This will overwrite the NODE_ENV setting during runtime and for the compiled

# Recognized values: test development production
# Default value: empty

# MongoDB connect URI. Specify auth credentials if necessary. YOU MUST *NOT*
# SPECIFY A DATABASE AT THE END!
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017

# Dedicated port to be used by the MongoDB Memory Server during unit tests.
# Especially useful when stepping through code, since you can always access the
# db at `mongodb://127.0.0.1:MONGODB_MS_PORT` when the debugger is paused.
# Tip: call `jest.setTimeout()` with a large number (i.e. 10**6) to ensure the
# MongoClient isn't closed randomly leading to strange errors.
#
# Leave this blank to choose any random port (not recommended). Note: this
# option is also used when Node is started in debug mode, e.g. `node
# --inspect-brk` or `node --debug`, or if the debugger is attached before the
# database connection is memoized.
MONGODB_MS_PORT=6666

#   DISABLED_API_VERSIONS=1,2
#   DISABLED_API_VERSIONS=3,5,7
#
# Note that `DISABLED_API_VERSIONS=` (i.e. empty) means no

IGNORE_RATE_LIMITS=false

# If !false, no one will be able to use the API.
LOCKOUT_ALL_CLIENTS=false

# Controls what request methods are allowed. Empty means all are allowed
# (default).
#
# Example, to make API read-only:
#   DISALLOWED_METHODS=POST,PUT
DISALLOWED_METHODS=

# Every Nth request will be be cancelled and an HTTP 555 response returned. Note
# that, in addition to every Nth request, the very first request sent to the API
# will also return a contrived error. Set to 0 to disable all contrived errors.

### EXTERNAL SCRIPT VARIABLES ###
# (optional unless using the relevant external script)

# How often this script is going to be invoked. This doesn't determine anything
