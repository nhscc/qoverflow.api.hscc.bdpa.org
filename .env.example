MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017

# Dedicated port to be used by the MongoDB Memory Server during unit tests.
# Especially useful when stepping through code, since you can always access the
# db at `mongodb://127.0.0.1:MONGODB_MS_PORT` when the debugger is paused.
# Tip: call `jest.setTimeout()` with a large number (i.e. 10**6) to ensure the
# MongoClient isn't closed randomly leading to strange errors.
#
# Leave this blank to choose any random port (not recommended). Note: this
# option is also used when Node is started in debug mode, e.g. `node
# --inspect-brk` or `node --debug`, or if the debugger is attached before the
